# SMT to DIP Breakout Boards

Breakout boards to convert SMT chips to DIP format for use in breadboard prototyping.

These designs have all been validated against DirtyPCBs and OSHPark design rules, but most have not been panelized and sent off to be fabricated.

Be mindful of sizing when using QFN components. I noticed when developing my QFN-28 board that not all QFN-28 chips are created with equal footprints.
